# Data Structures Project - School Project 2023

This project implements different types of linear data structures in C++ with interactive menus and ASCII art visualization. This demonstrates my understanding of fundamental data structures by implementing five different types of linked lists from scratch. Each implementation includes:

- Complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Memory management with proper constructors/destructors
- Interactive console menus for testing functionality
- ASCII art visualization to show list structure graphically
- Professional code organization with separated headers and source files

The project showcases object-oriented programming principles, dynamic memory allocation, and proper C++ project structure with modular design.

## Implemented Data Structures

- **Linked List** - Simple singly linked list
- **Circular Linked List** - Circular singly linked list  
- **Doubly Linked List** - Doubly linked list with forward and backward pointers
- **Doubly Circular Linked List** - Circular doubly linked list
- **Orthogonal Linked List** - Multi-dimensional linked list with 4-way navigation
